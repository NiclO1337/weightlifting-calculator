A simple React-based tool to help lifters quickly calculate training weights from their 1RM (one-rep max). </br>
Instead of doing the math in your head or looking up tables, this app shows you exactly how much weight to load on the bar for different intensity percentages.

## ‚ú® Why use it?

‚úÖ Stop guessing what 74% of 137.5kg is ‚Äî get the exact number instantly.

‚úÖ Plan sessions more efficiently by saving your current working percentages.

‚úÖ Get plate breakdowns for your barbell (based on available plates).

‚úÖ Works directly in your browser ‚Äî no installation required (but you can install it as a PWA if you want offline support).

## üîë Key Features

- 1RM Input ‚Äì enter your current one-rep max and all calculations update instantly.

- Percentage List ‚Äì quickly check common training zones (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%).

- Detailed Ranges ‚Äì click a percentage to expand and view all weights in that range (e.g., 70‚Äì79%).

- Saved Percentages ‚Äì save your frequently used percentages (e.g., 68%, 76%, 82%) for quick reference.

- Custom Rounding ‚Äì round to your preferred increment (0.5kg, 1kg, 2.5kg, etc.).

- Barbell Plate Calculator ‚Äì see which plates to load on each side of the bar, based on available gym plates.

- Local Storage Support ‚Äì your settings and saved percentages persist even if you close the browser.
